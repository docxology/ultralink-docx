## Epistemic Justice & Hygiene

Epistemic justice refers to fairness in how knowledge is shared, accessed, and valued. In our community:

* **Respect knowledge diversity**: We value different forms of knowledge and expertise, including formal education, lived experience, cultural knowledge, and practical skills.

* **Practice intellectual humility**: Recognize the limits of your knowledge. Be open to being wrong and learning from others.

* **Credit appropriately**: Acknowledge others' intellectual contributions and cite sources properly.

* **Avoid epistemic exploitation**: Don't burden marginalized community members with educating others about their experiences.

* **Combat misinformation**: Take responsibility for the accuracy of information you share. When uncertain, indicate the level of confidence or source of your claims.

* **Facilitate access to knowledge**: Support efforts to make knowledge accessible to all community members, regardless of background or resources.

* **Challenge epistemic injustice**: Speak up when you notice patterns of dismissing certain perspectives based on who is expressing them rather than their merit.

## Cognitive Security

Cognitive security involves protecting the information environment from manipulation and ensuring the mental wellbeing of community members:

* **Resist manipulation techniques**: Be aware of and avoid using dark patterns, manufactured consensus, and other manipulation techniques that undermine autonomous decision-making.

* **Practice informed consent**: Ensure community members have full understanding before engaging in activities that could affect their cognitive processes or expose them to potentially harmful content.

* **Protect against information hazards**: Take appropriate precautions when discussing topics that could enable harm if misused.

* **Promote mental clarity**: Structure discussions and information to reduce unnecessary cognitive load and confusion.

* **Respect cognitive boundaries**: Recognize that community members have different cognitive needs and limitations. Respect requests to adjust the pace, complexity, or emotional intensity of interactions.

* **Cultivate digital literacy**: Support community members in developing skills to critically evaluate information and navigate online spaces safely.

* **Maintain information integrity**: Do not deliberately distort facts, misrepresent others' positions, or engage in sophistry.

## Accessibility Commitment

We are committed to making UltraLink and its community accessible to everyone:

* **Design for accessibility**: Ensure software, documentation, and community spaces are designed with accessibility in mind.

* **Provide accommodations**: Make reasonable accommodations to ensure all community members can participate fully.

* **Use accessible communication**: Structure communications to be accessible to people using assistive technologies, and provide alternative formats when needed.

* **Educate on accessibility**: Learn about different accessibility needs and share this knowledge within the community.

* **Solicit feedback**: Actively seek input from community members with disabilities about how to improve accessibility.

* **Prioritize fixes**: Treat accessibility issues as critical bugs that should be prioritized in development.

* **Go beyond compliance**: Aim to exceed minimum accessibility standards, focusing on real-world usability for people with diverse needs.

## Community Care

We believe in fostering a community that actively cares for the wellbeing of its members:

* **Practice mutual support**: Offer assistance to community members facing challenges, whether technical or personal.

* **Respect boundaries**: Honor others' stated limits and capacity. Don't pressure people to overextend themselves.

* **Encourage rest**: Recognize the importance of rest and recovery. Discourage burnout culture.

* **Provide emotional support**: Create space for community members to express difficulties and receive compassionate responses.

* **Recognize invisible labor**: Acknowledge and value the often invisible work of maintaining community health, documentation, and supporting newcomers.

* **Cultivate psychological safety**: Foster an environment where people feel safe to take risks, make mistakes, and be vulnerable.

* **Address conflict healthily**: Approach disagreements with a goal of mutual understanding rather than "winning."

## Service & Stewardship

We view our community as a shared resource that requires ongoing stewardship:

* **Share skills and knowledge**: Freely share your expertise with others in the community, particularly with newcomers.

* **Mentor and teach**: Take time to help others develop their skills and understanding.

* **Contribute to sustainability**: Help ensure the project remains viable for the long term through appropriate contributions.

* **Practice environmental consciousness**: Consider the environmental impact of our technical decisions and operations.

* **Be responsive to needs**: Listen and respond to the evolving needs of the community and users.

* **Leave things better**: Aim to leave the codebase, documentation, and community in better condition than you found it.

* **Practice ethical leadership**: Those in leadership positions should model service-oriented behavior and prioritize community welfare over personal gain.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at DanielAriFriedman@gmail.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
