# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This document answers common questions about UltraLink, its features, and how to use it effectively.

## General Questions

### What is UltraLink?

UltraLink is a framework for managing and visualizing rich relational content with context, meaning, and evolution over time. Going beyond traditional hypertext, UltraLink enhances connections with vector embeddings, semantic understanding, temporal awareness, and interactive exploration capabilities. Ultralink can render into many output formats (image, PDF, Bayesian Graph, website, Obsidian knowledge repository).

### How is UltraLink different from traditional hyperlinks?

Traditional hyperlinks are simple, unidirectional connections between web pages or resources. UltraLink enhances these connections with:

- Rich metadata and context
- Bidirectional awareness
- Semantic understanding through vector embeddings
- Temporal tracking of how relationships evolve
- Type-based relationship categorization
- Strength/confidence metrics for connections
- Interactive visualization capabilities

### What types of applications is UltraLink best suited for?

UltraLink excels in applications that involve complex knowledge and relationships:

- Knowledge management systems
- Research databases and citation networks
- Documentation systems
- Content management systems
- Learning platforms with concept maps
- Information dashboards
- Network analysis applications
- Data exploration interfaces

### Is UltraLink open source?

Yes, UltraLink is released under the MIT License, making it free to use in both commercial and non-commercial applications.

## Technical Questions

### What technologies does UltraLink use?

UltraLink is built primarily with:
- JavaScript/TypeScript for the core library
- Vector embedding models for semantic understanding
- Graph database principles for relationship management
- D3.js and other visualization libraries for interactive displays

### Does UltraLink require a database?

No, UltraLink can operate with different storage backends:
- In-memory storage (no persistence)
- File-based storage (JSON, etc.)
- IndexedDB (for browsers)
- Various database systems (MongoDB, SQL databases, etc.)

The storage system is modular, allowing you to choose what works best for your use case.

### Can UltraLink work in the browser?

Yes, UltraLink has a browser-compatible build that can run entirely client-side. It can use browser storage mechanisms like IndexedDB for persistence.

### How does UltraLink handle large datasets?

UltraLink implements several strategies for handling large datasets:
- Efficient data structures
- Lazy loading of data
- Index-based retrieval
- Pagination for large result sets
- Streaming for processing large collections
- Query optimization

For very large datasets, UltraLink can connect to external databases that are optimized for scale.

### Does UltraLink support concurrent users?

The core UltraLink library itself doesn't handle user management or concurrency, but:
- When used with a server-based architecture, concurrent access can be managed through standard web application techniques
- When using database backends that support transactions, concurrent modifications can be handled safely

## Feature Questions

### How does the vector embedding feature work?

UltraLink can generate vector embeddings from textual content using:
1. Built-in embedding models
2. Connections to external APIs (OpenAI, etc.)
3. Custom embedding functions

These embeddings enable:
- Semantic search
- Content similarity analysis
- Automatic relationship suggestions
- Clustering of related content

### What visualization options does UltraLink provide?

UltraLink includes several visualization components:
- Network/graph visualizations
- Matrix views of relationships
- Timeline views for temporal aspects
- Dashboard components for analytics
- Vector space visualizations
- Interactive filtering and exploration tools

### Can UltraLink integrate with my existing tools?

UltraLink provides integrations with several ecosystems:
- Knowledge management tools (Obsidian, Logseq, etc.)
- Vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.)
- Graph databases (Neo4j, ArangoDB, etc.)
- LLM services (OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.)

For custom integrations, UltraLink offers a flexible API and export formats.

### Does UltraLink support custom entity and relationship types?

Yes, UltraLink allows you to define:
- Custom entity types with specific attributes and validation rules
- Custom relationship types with their own properties
- Domain-specific schemas for your particular application
- Validation rules for maintaining data integrity

## Implementation Questions
