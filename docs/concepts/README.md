## Core Concept Areas

UltraLink is built around five core concept areas that work together to provide a comprehensive framework for managing and visualizing relational content:

### 1. Relational Paradigm

The foundation of UltraLink is a rich relational model that goes beyond simple links to provide context, meaning, and structure to relationships.

[**Learn more about the Relational Paradigm â†’**](./relational-paradigm.md)

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Entity A] -- "references (0.92)" --> B[Entity B]
    B -- "contradicts (0.75)" --> C[Entity C]
    C -- "expands (0.88)" --> D[Entity D]
    D -- "supports (0.67)" --> A
```

Key concepts:
- **Entities**: Nodes in the knowledge graph with types, attributes, and metadata
- **Relationships**: Typed, directed connections between entities with attributes
- **Attributes**: Properties that describe entities and relationships
- **Metadata**: Information about the graph itself, including schema and statistics

### 2. Vector Space Model

UltraLink uses vector embeddings to represent semantic meaning and enable advanced operations like similarity search and clustering.

[**Learn more about the Vector Space Model â†’**](./vector-space.md)

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Vector Space"
        direction LR
        A((A))
        B((B))
        C((C))
        D((D))
        
        A --- B
        B --- C
        C --- D
        A --- D
    end
```

Key concepts:
- **Vector Embeddings**: Numerical representations of entities in multi-dimensional space
- **Similarity Metrics**: Methods for measuring semantic similarity between entities
- **Clustering**: Grouping similar entities based on their vector representations
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Techniques for visualizing high-dimensional vectors

### 3. Temporal Evolution

UltraLink tracks how entities, relationships, and knowledge evolve over time, enabling historical analysis and temporal visualization.

[**Learn more about Temporal Evolution â†’**](./temporal-evolution.md)

```mermaid
timeline
    title Knowledge Evolution
    section Phase 1
        Initial State : Basic Structure
        Early Development : Growing Connections
    section Phase 2
        Maturity : Dense Network
        Refinement : Optimized Structure
    section Phase 3
        Transformation : New Patterns
        Evolution : Advanced Structure
```

Key concepts:
- **Versioning**: Tracking different versions of the knowledge graph
- **Change History**: Recording modifications to entities and relationships
- **Temporal Analysis**: Analyzing how the graph evolves over time
- **Time-based Filtering**: Viewing the graph at specific points in time

### 4. Network Analysis

UltraLink provides tools for analyzing the structure and dynamics of the knowledge graph as a network.

[**Learn more about Network Analysis â†’**](./network-analysis.md)

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Network Analysis"
        direction LR
        A((A))
        B((B))
        C((C))
        D((D))
        E((E))
        
        A --> B
        B --> C
        C --> D
        D --> E
        A --> E
    end
```

Key concepts:
- **Graph Metrics**: Measures of network structure and properties
- **Centrality**: Identifying important nodes in the network
- **Path Analysis**: Finding and analyzing paths between entities
- **Community Detection**: Identifying groups of closely related entities

### 5. Interactive Visualization

UltraLink provides rich, interactive visualizations for exploring and understanding complex relational data.

[**Learn more about Visualization â†’**](../guides/visualization.md)

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Visualization Types"
        Network["Network View"]
        Vector["Vector Space"]
        Timeline["Timeline View"]
        Matrix["Matrix View"]
    end
```

Key concepts:
- **Network Visualization**: Visual representation of the graph structure
- **Vector Space Visualization**: 2D/3D representation of vector embeddings
- **Temporal Visualization**: Visualizing changes over time
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Combining multiple visualizations for comprehensive analysis

## Concept Relationships

These core concepts are deeply interconnected and work together to provide a comprehensive framework:

```mermaid
graph TB
    RP[Relational Paradigm] --> VS[Vector Space]
    RP --> NA[Network Analysis]
    RP --> TE[Temporal Evolution]
    
    VS --> NA
    VS --> IV[Interactive Visualization]
    
    TE --> IV
    NA --> IV
    
    RP --> IV
```

## Practical Application

Understanding how these concepts apply in practice is essential for effective use of UltraLink:

### Example: Research Knowledge Graph

```javascript
// Create a research knowledge graph
const researchKG = new UltraLink();

// Add entities (Relational Paradigm)
const paper = researchKG.addEntity('paper-2023', 'publication', {
  title: 'Vector Embeddings in Knowledge Graphs',
  authors: ['alice-chen', 'bob-smith']
});

// Add relationships (Relational Paradigm)
researchKG.addLink('paper-2023', 'vector-embeddings', 'introduces', {
  importance: 0.95
});

// Generate vector embeddings (Vector Space)
await researchKG.generateVectors();

// Find similar entities (Vector Space)
const similar = researchKG.findSimilar('paper-2023', {
  minSimilarity: 0.7
});

// Track changes over time (Temporal Evolution)
researchKG.createVersion('v1.0');
researchKG.updateEntity('paper-2023', { citations: 10 });
researchKG.createVersion('v1.1');

// Analyze network properties (Network Analysis)
const centrality = researchKG.analyze.centrality();
const communities = researchKG.analyze.communities();

// Create interactive visualization (Visualization)
const dashboard = researchKG.createDashboard({
  views: ['network', 'vector', 'temporal']
});
```
